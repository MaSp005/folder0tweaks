# Folder 0 Tweaks

This is a simple mod that, when viewing your level list on folder 0, shows the folder number of each level, helping you with organizing your level folders.

It also offers the setting to exclude levels which are not explicitly on folder 0 from being shown on folder 0. If you like having all your levels categorized, this helps to quickly sort everything out of the nasty catch-all.
